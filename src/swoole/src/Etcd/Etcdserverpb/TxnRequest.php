/**
 * From google paxosdb paper:
 * Our implementation hinges around a powerful primitive which we call MultiOp. All other database
 * operations except for iteration are implemented as a single call to MultiOp. A MultiOp is applied atomically
 * and consists of three components:
 * 1. A list of tests called guard. Each test in guard checks a single entry in the database. It may check
 * for the absence or presence of a value, or compare with a given value. Two different tests in the guard
 * may apply to the same or different entries in the database. All tests in the guard are applied and
 * MultiOp returns the results. If all tests are true, MultiOp executes t op (see item 2 below), otherwise
 * it executes f op (see item 3 below).
 * 2. A list of database operations called t op. Each operation in the list is either an insert, delete, or
 * lookup operation, and applies to a single database entry. Two different operations in the list may apply
 * to the same or different entries in the database. These operations are executed
 * if guard evaluates to
 * true.
 * 3. A list of database operations called f op. Like t op, but executed if guard evaluates to false.
